## About the Speakers
### Ivan Čukić
Ivan Čukić is the author of "Functional Programming in C++" from Manning Publishing, KDE developer, and advocate of the Free/Libre Software movement.

For a fistful of idioms
Every language has its own idioms that the developers using it should know. C++ has its own. Some are meant to increase readability, some to squeeze as much performance as possible, and some are created to make the code safer. But even with many idioms being in developed by the C++ community, a majority of C++ developers don't know or don't use them. This talk will cover some of the more useful idioms, with a main focus on the idioms that increase the overall safety of systems.

### Alexander Fokin
Alexander Fokin is a member of the ISO C++ Committee. He has been giving talks on C++ since 2016, and has been writing C++ code for fun and living for close to 20 years.

What’s New in C++26
The talk will cover new things that we should expect in C++26 and will be a report from Alexander's March tip to committee meeting.

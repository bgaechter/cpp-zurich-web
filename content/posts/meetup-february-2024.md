Hey everyone

Let's keep the pace. This time we will have just one talk, so more time for discussion. We kindly you to register with your first and last name.

## Agenda

* 18:00 - 18:30 Welcome snacks and socialising
* 18:30 - 19:20 Specifiers, qualifiers and how they interact - Mikhail Matrosov


In C++98, we already had const, volatile, static, extern and inline. In C++11, thread_local and constexpr were added. In C++17, inline variables were introduced. In C++20, we've got consteval and constinit. But have you ever wondered what a static inline thread_local constexpr const volatile variable is?

In this talk, Mikhail will attempt to break down all this variety of keywords. We'll recall linkage and storage duration. We'll understand the connection between static and constexpr, between extern and inline. And we'll realize why it took us almost 20 years to learn how to properly declare constants.
